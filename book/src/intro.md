# The Jiff Book: Date and Time in Rust

Jiff is a datetime library for [Rust] that encourages you to jump into
the pit of success.

This web site provides a book for the library by walking through the concepts
of date and time, with a specific focus on programmatic manipulation of time.

The target audience for this book is anyone who wants to learn more about how
computers handle time. While this book focuses specifically on Rust, most code
snippets are simple enough that basic familiarity with programming concepts is
likely sufficient.
