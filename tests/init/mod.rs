/// It's supposed to test how long it takes for the first call to
/// `Zoned::now()` to run. The specific problem is that, when this test was
/// written, Jiff would walk `/usr/share/zoneinfo` and catalog all time zones
/// in that directory. While this is generally not much of a problem, it can be
/// on a very slow file system. In particular, this can evolve a few syscalls
/// per file, and there might be a couple thousand files inside the directory.
/// Moreover, Jiff was doing a 4-byte read of each file to check if it was TZif
/// or not.
