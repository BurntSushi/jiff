/*!
A wrapper around `zic` to generate binary TZif data for `jiff-tzdb`.

It would be nice to abandon using `zic` entirely in favor of our own compiler.
A substantial part of this is done in `jiff/src/tz/zic.rs` in the form of a
complete parser for the zic input format. However, what remains is the actual
conversion step from the data into time zone transition rules. This was
non-trivial enough that I gave up, but it would be very nice to have that
working. From there, we could use it to generate the TZif files themselves.
And at that point, we wouldn't need `zic` any more.

const USAGE: &'static str = r#"
Generate TZif data for the jiff-tzdb crate.

USAGE:
    jiff-cli generate zoneinfo <tzdata-path> <output-directory>

The output of this program is a directory like `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on most
Linux distributions. This output can then be used as an input to
`jiff-cli generate jiff-tzdb` to generate the actual Rust source code for
the `jiff-tzdb` crate. The purpose of this command is to centralize the
configuration used to build the binary data for the `jiff-tzdb` crate.

Here's an example usage from the root of this repository. If you already
have `zic` installed on your system (the tzdata compiler), then you can just
download and extract the tzdata files:

    mkdir tzdata2024a
    cd tzdata2024a
    curl -LO 'https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2024a.tar.gz'
    tar xf tzdata2024a.tar.gz

If your system doesn't have `zic`, then you can download the complete tzdb
release (which includes both the code for `zic` and the tzdata files). You may
also need to do this step if the tzdata format changes and the copy of `zic`
on your system is too old to read the latest tzdata files.

    curl -LO 'https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdb-2024a.tar.lz'
    tar xf tzdb-2024a.tar.lz
    cd tzdb-2024a

And then build the `zic` compiler:

    make

This should drop a `zic` program in the current directory. You'll then want to
pass the path to this `zic` program via the `--zic` flag to
`jiff-cli generate zoneinfo`. The `zic` program is responsible for transforming
tzdata files (like `northamerica`) into the binary TZif files typically found
in `/usr/share/zoneinfo`.

Then, run:

    jiff-cli generate zoneinfo path/to/tzdata2024a /tmp/zoneinfo-2024a

If you want to re-generate the Rust code for jiff-tzdb, then from the root of
this repository, you'd do:

    jiff-cli generate jiff-tzdb /tmp/zoneinfo-2024a
