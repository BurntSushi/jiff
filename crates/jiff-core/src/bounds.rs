/*!
Defines boundary types and their corresponding error values.

The main trait in this module is [`Bounds`]. It is implemented by each of
several boundary types describing a range of contiguous values used by Jiff.
For example, [`Year`] corresponds to the range of support calendar year values.

Each range type has concrete methods defined on it that simply forward to its
corresponding method on `Bounds`. For example, [`Year::check`] forwards to the
default implementation of [`Bounds::check`]. These concrete wrappers exist to
make calling the routines more ergonomic. For example, they don't require that
the `Bounds` trait be in scope. Additionally, a [`Year::checkc`] concrete
method is provide for use in `const` contexts. This is not available on the
`Bounds` trait because generics are not yet supported (as of 2026-02-13) in
a `const` context.

/// An interface for defining boundaries on integer values.
///
/// An implementation of this trait defines a single contiguous range used
/// inside of Jiff. For example, the allowed range of years is `-9999..=9999`.
///
/// Each implementation defines its primitive representation, which is usally
/// the smallest signed integer type that can hold the minimum and maximum
/// values. This trait provides `check`, `checked_add` and `checked_mul`
/// methods that callers likely do not need to override.
///
/// Other than the associated types and constants, the only required method
/// that callers must implement is `error()`.
///
/// # History & Design
///
/// It took a lot of design iteration to arrive at this trait.
/// [Jiff originally started with an Ada-inspired ranged integer
/// abstraction][jiff-range-history]. At first, it worked really well and
/// seemed to do a decent job at uncovering bugs related to values going
/// outside of their intended range. Or worse, actual integer overflow. This
/// particular abstraction had three key properties:
///
/// 1. Each ranged integer type corresponded to a single contiguous range
/// (e.g., `Year` was `-9999..=9999`), and the range values were defined by
/// const type parameters.
/// 2. The value inside of a ranged integer was permitted to "drift" outside
/// of its defined range (but not outside of its primitive representation).
/// A panic would only manifest when one tried to look inside the ranged
/// integer and access its primitive representation (e.g., `Date::year`).
/// 3. Ranged integers kept track of their minimum and maximum possible values,
/// *at runtime*, but only when `debug_assertions` were enabled. So when you
/// did `x + y`, the result wouldn't just be the actual addition, but also
/// addition performed on the corresponding min and max values on each of `x`
/// and `y`.
///
/// When all three of these properties combined, you got an excellent bug
/// finding tool without necessarily needing to write tests covering all of the
/// edge cases. For example, if you did `x + y` and the result only went out
/// of range when `x` and `y` were some extreme values, you'd get an immediate
/// panic once you accessed the value even when using non-extreme values.
/// That's because the extreme values are computed dynamically at runtime.
///
/// Unfortunately, as Jiff grew bigger, ranged integers became more and more
/// annoying. They have two fatal flaws as conceived above:
///
/// 1. If you "escape" outside of a ranged integer at any point, you lose the
/// tracked min and max values. And thus you lose advantage of ranged integers
/// in the first place.
/// 2. Because of (1), it was exceptionally difficult to do any sort of clever
/// representation-based optimizations. Since a ranged integer had its own
/// representation, trying to do, e.g., bit-packing was effectively impossible.
///
/// There were some other downsides, although I didn't perceive them as fatal
/// on their own (but they certaintly contributed to my decision to abdandon
/// them):
///
/// * Since these were custom types and they were generic, literally none of
/// them worked in a `const` context.
/// * Whenever there was conditional control flow involving ranged integers,
/// it was necessary to do strange contortions to get their internal min/max
/// values to line up correctly.
/// * As time pressed on, the panics surfaced by ranged integers were more and
/// more likely to be as a result of "holding it wrong" and not because of any
/// actual bugs in the arithmetic.
///
/// With all of that said, a datetime library has to be quite paranoid about
/// the range of values it permits. And error messages really benefit from
/// being able to encode information about the allowed range so that users know
/// what is and isn't illegal. Hence, I settled on this lighter weight design
/// that still encodes ranges as a static property of the program, but as
/// associated types on a trait. And then that trait provides a few very
/// primitive operations (like checking if an integer is in bounds) that
/// produce an appropriate error message on failure.
///
/// Note also that this trait is specifically not implemented for `i128`.
/// It's only implemented for `i8`, `i16`, `i32` and `i64`. This is because
/// the `check` function accepts an `i64` as the type that can contain all
/// possible values for _any_ range type. And then that value is checked before
/// potentially being converted to a smaller primitive representation. If this
/// trait supported `i128`, then one would want a `check` function where
/// parameters get converted to `i128` and then their ranges are checked. I
/// did not want this because of the extra costs associated with `i128`.
///
/// Moreover, Jiff is using `i128` in a vanishingly small number of locations.
/// I don't think I'll ever be able to eliminate it entirely, but the number
/// of locations is small enough that they are special cased and don't need to
/// fit into this infrastructure.
///
/// Finally, a key property of this design is that error values carry no
/// associated data. Instead, they are instantiated as implementations of
/// this trait, and that implementation provides all of the information
/// necessary to craft a half-way decent error message.
