/*!
Implements [TZif] time zone parsing and transition handling.

The TZif format is used by the [Time Zone Database].

The parser in this module is designed to handle untrusted input. That is, there
is no input that should cause it to panic or allocate memory in a way that is
not proportional to the size of the TZif data.

These binary files are the ones commonly found in Unix distributions in the
`/usr/share/zoneinfo` directory.

/// 2. The offset of the transition is greater than the offset of the previous
/// transition. That means there is a "gap" in local time between the
/// transitions. This typically corresponds to entering daylight saving time.

/// 3. The offset of the transition is less than the offset of the previous
/// transition. That means there is a "fold" in local time where time is
/// repeated. This typically corresponds to leaving daylight saving time. It
/// is usually, but not always, 1 hour.
///
/// # More explanation
///
/// This, when combined with `civil_starts` and `civil_ends` in
/// `Transitions`, explicitly represents ambiguous wall clock times that
/// occur at the boundaries of transitions.
///
/// The start of the wall clock time is always the earlier possible wall clock
/// time that could occur with this transition's corresponding offset. For a
/// gap, it's the previous transition's offset. For a fold, it's the current
/// transition's offset.
///
/// For example, DST for `America/New_York` began on `2024-03-10T07:00:00+00`.
/// The offset prior to this instant in time is `-05`, corresponding
/// to standard time (EST). Thus, in wall clock time, DST began at
/// `2024-03-10T02:00:00`. And since this is a DST transition that jumps ahead
/// an hour, the start of DST also corresponds to the start of a gap. That is,
/// the times `02:00:00` through `02:59:59` never appear on a clock for this
/// hour. The question is thus: which offset should we apply to `02:00:00`?
/// We could apply the offset from the earlier transition `-05` and get
/// `2024-03-10T01:00:00-05` (that's `2024-03-10T06:00:00+00`), or we could
/// apply the offset from the later transition `-04` and get
/// `2024-03-10T03:00:00-04` (that's `2024-03-10T07:00:00+00`).
///
/// So in the above, we would have a `Gap` variant where `start` (inclusive) is
/// `2024-03-10T02:00:00` and `end` (exclusive) is `2024-03-10T03:00:00`.
///
/// The fold case is the same idea, but where the same time is repeated.
/// For example, in `America/New_York`, standard time began on
/// `2024-11-03T06:00:00+00`. The offset prior to this instant in time
/// is `-04`, corresponding to DST (EDT). Thus, in wall clock time, DST
/// ended at `2024-11-03T02:00:00`. However, since this is a fold, the
/// actual set of ambiguous times begins at `2024-11-03T01:00:00` and
/// ends at `2024-11-03T01:59:59.999999999`. That is, the wall clock time
/// `2024-11-03T02:00:00` is unambiguous.
///
/// So in the fold case above, we would have a `Fold` variant where
/// `start` (inclusive) is `2024-11-03T01:00:00` and `end` (exclusive) is
/// `2024-11-03T02:00:00`.
///
/// Since this gets bundled in with the sorted sequence of transitions, we'll
/// use the "start" time in all three cases as our target of binary search.
/// Once we land on a transition, we'll know our given wall clock time is
/// greater than or equal to its start wall clock time. At that point, to
/// determine if there is ambiguity, we merely need to determine if the given
/// wall clock time is less than the corresponding `end` time. If it is, then
/// it falls in a gap or fold. Otherwise, it's unambiguous.
///
/// Note that we could compute these datetime values while searching for the
/// correct transition, but there's a fair bit of math involved in going
/// between timestamps (which is what TZif gives us) and calendar datetimes
/// (which is what we're given as input). It is also necessary that we offset
/// the timestamp given in TZif at some point, since it is in UTC and the
/// datetime given is in wall clock time. So I decided it would be worth
/// pre-computing what we need in terms of what the input is. This way, we
/// don't need to do any conversions, or indeed, any arithmetic at all, for
