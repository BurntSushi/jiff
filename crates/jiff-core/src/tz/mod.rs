/// POSIX says this:
///
/// > Indicate no less than three, nor more than {TZNAME_MAX}, bytes that are
/// > the designation for the standard (std) or the alternative (dst -such as
/// > Daylight Savings Time) timezone.
///
/// But it doesn't seem worth the trouble to query `TZNAME_MAX`. Interestingly,
/// IANA says:
///
/// > are 3 or more characters specifying the standard and daylight saving time
/// > (DST) zone abbreviations
///
/// Which implies that IANA thinks there is no limit. But that seems unwise.
/// Moreover, in practice, it seems like the `date` utility supports fairly
/// long abbreviations. On my mac (so, BSD `date` as I understand it):
///
/// ```text
/// $ TZ=ZZZ5YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY date
/// Sun Mar 17 20:05:58 YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 2024
/// ```
///
/// And on my Linux machine (so, GNU `date`):
///
/// ```text
/// $ TZ=ZZZ5YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY date
/// Sun Mar 17 08:05:36 PM YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 2024
/// ```
///
/// I don't know exactly what limit these programs use, but 30 seems good
/// enough?
///
/// Previously, I had been using 255 and stuffing the string in a `Box<str>`.
/// But as part of work on [#168], I was looking to remove allocation from as
/// many places as possible. And this was one candidate. But making room on the
/// stack for 255 byte abbreviations seemed gratuitous. So I picked something
/// smaller. If we come across an abbreviation bigger than this max, then we'll
/// error.
///
/// In environments with dynamic memory allocation, this maximum is just the
/// maximum number of bytes we're willing to spend on array-backed storage of
/// a time zone abbreviation. If we hit anything bigger, we'll use the heap.
///
/// In core-only environments, we use a bigger limit as mentioned above.
/// Anything bigger than this will result in a parse error.
