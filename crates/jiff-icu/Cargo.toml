# Integration crates in Jiff are explicitly isolated from the workspace to
# avoid dependencies accumulating. I was originally motivated to do this
# because rustc kept getting stun-locked compiling diesel. And this was somehow
# happening every time I saved a file inside of Jiff proper. So I just ragequit
# including everything in the same workspace and put integration crates (and
# examples) into their own little bloated fiefdoms.
