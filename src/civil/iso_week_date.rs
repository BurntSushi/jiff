/// A type representing an [ISO 8601 week date].
///
/// The ISO 8601 week date scheme devises a calendar where days are identified
/// by their year, week number and weekday. All years have either precisely
/// 52 or 53 weeks.
///
/// The first week of an ISO 8601 year corresponds to the week containing the
/// first Thursday of the year. For this reason, an ISO 8601 week year can be
/// mismatched with the day's corresponding Gregorian year. For example, the
/// ISO 8601 week date for `1995-01-01` is `1994-W52-7` (with `7` corresponding
/// to Sunday).
///
/// ISO 8601 also considers Monday to be the start of the week, and uses
/// a 1-based numbering system. That is, Monday corresponds to `1` while
/// Sunday corresponds to `7` and is the last day of the week. Weekdays are
/// encapsulated by the [`Weekday`] type, which provides routines for easily
/// converting between different schemes (such as weeks where Sunday is the
/// beginning).
///
/// [ISO 8601 week date]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date
///
/// # Use case
///
/// Some domains use this method of timekeeping. Otherwise, unless you
/// specifically want a week oriented calendar, it's likely that you'll never
/// need to care about this type.
///
/// # Default value
///
/// For convenience, this type implements the `Default` trait. Its default
/// value is the first day of the zeroth year. i.e., `0000-W1-1`.
///
/// # Example: sample dates
///
/// This example shows a couple ISO 8601 week dates and their corresponding
/// Gregorian equivalents:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::{ISOWeekDate, Weekday, date};
///
/// let d = date(2019, 12, 30);
/// let weekdate = ISOWeekDate::new(2020, 1, Weekday::Monday).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(d.to_iso_week_date(), weekdate);
///
/// let d = date(2024, 3, 9);
/// let weekdate = ISOWeekDate::new(2024, 10, Weekday::Saturday).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(d.to_iso_week_date(), weekdate);
/// ```
///
/// # Example: overlapping leap and long years
///
/// A "long" ISO 8601 week year is a year with 53 weeks. That is, it is a year
/// that includes a leap week. This example shows all years in the 20th
/// century that are both Gregorian leap years and long years.
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let mut overlapping = vec![];
/// for year in 1900..=1999 {
///     let date = date(year, 1, 1);
///     if date.in_leap_year() && date.to_iso_week_date().in_long_year() {
///         overlapping.push(year);
///     }
/// }
/// assert_eq!(overlapping, vec![
///     1904, 1908, 1920, 1932, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1988, 1992,
/// ]);
/// ```
///
/// # Example: printing all weeks in a year
///
/// The ISO 8601 week calendar can be useful when you want to categorize
/// things into buckets of weeks where all weeks are exactly 7 days, _and_
/// you don't care as much about the precise Gregorian year. Here's an example
/// that prints all of the ISO 8601 weeks in one ISO 8601 week year:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::{ISOWeekDate, Weekday}, ToSpan};
///
/// let target_year = 2024;
/// let iso_week_date = ISOWeekDate::new(target_year, 1, Weekday::Monday)?;
/// // Create a series of dates via the Gregorian calendar. But since a
/// // Gregorian week and an ISO 8601 week calendar week are both 7 days,
/// // this works fine.
/// let weeks = iso_week_date
///     .date()
///     .series(1.week())
///     .map(|d| d.iso_week_date())
///     .take_while(|wd| wd.year() == target_year);
/// for start_of_week in weeks {
///     let end_of_week = start_of_week.last_of_week()?;
///     println!(
///         "ISO week {}: {} - {}",
///         start_of_week.week(),
///         start_of_week.date(),
///         end_of_week.date()
///     );
