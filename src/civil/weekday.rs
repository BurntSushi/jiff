use crate::error::Error;

/// A representation for the day of the week.
///
/// The default representation follows ISO 8601. That is, the week starts with
/// Monday and numbering starts at `1`. However, the various constructors and
/// accessors support using other schemes in wide use:
///
/// * [`Weekday::from_monday_zero_offset`] builds a weekday from
/// a scheme that starts the week on Monday at offset `0`, while
/// [`Weekday::to_monday_zero_offset`] converts to it.
/// * [`Weekday::from_monday_one_offset`] builds a weekday from a scheme
/// that starts the week on Monday at offset `1` (the default representation),
/// while [`Weekday::to_monday_one_offset`] converts to it.
/// * [`Weekday::from_sunday_zero_offset`] builds a weekday from
/// a scheme that starts the week on Sunday at offset `0`, while
/// [`Weekday::to_sunday_zero_offset`] converts to it.
/// * [`Weekday::from_sunday_one_offset`] builds a weekday from
/// a scheme that starts the week on Sunday at offset `1`, while
/// [`Weekday::to_sunday_one_offset`] converts to it.
///
/// # Arithmetic
///
/// This type provides [`Weekday::wrapping_add`] and [`Weekday::wrapping_sub`]
/// for performing wrapping arithmetic on weekdays. These are also available
/// via operator overloading:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::Weekday;
///
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Monday + 1, Weekday::Tuesday);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Sunday - 1, Weekday::Saturday);
/// ```
///
/// # Comparisons
///
/// This type provides `Eq` and `PartialEq` trait implementations for easy
/// comparison:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::Weekday;
///
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Wednesday, Weekday::Wednesday + 7);
/// assert_ne!(Weekday::Thursday, Weekday::Friday);
/// ```
///
/// But this type specifically does not provide `Ord` or `PartialOrd` trait
/// implementations. Such an implementation would require deciding whether
/// Sunday is less than Monday or greater than Monday. The former case
/// corresponds to a week scheme where Sunday is the first day in the week,
/// where as the latter corresponds to a scheme where Monday is the first day.
/// Since both schemes are in widespread use, it would be inappropriate to bake
/// in an assumption of one or the other. Instead, one can convert a weekday
/// into the desired offset scheme, and then compare the offsets:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::Weekday;
///
/// let (sun, mon) = (Weekday::Sunday, Weekday::Monday);
/// assert!(sun.to_sunday_zero_offset() < mon.to_sunday_zero_offset());
/// assert!(sun.to_monday_zero_offset() > mon.to_monday_zero_offset());
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows the result of converting to and from different schemes:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::Weekday;
///
/// // The different representations of Monday.
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Monday.to_monday_zero_offset(), 0);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Monday.to_monday_one_offset(), 1);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Monday.to_sunday_zero_offset(), 1);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Monday.to_sunday_one_offset(), 2);
///
/// // The different representations of Sunday.
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Sunday.to_monday_zero_offset(), 6);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Sunday.to_monday_one_offset(), 7);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Sunday.to_sunday_zero_offset(), 0);
/// assert_eq!(Weekday::Sunday.to_sunday_one_offset(), 1);
