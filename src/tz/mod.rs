/*!
Routines for interacting with time zones and the zoneinfo database.

The main type in this module is [`TimeZone`]. For most use cases, you may not
even need to interact with this type at all. For example, this code snippet
converts a civil datetime to a zone aware datetime:

```
use jiff::civil::date;

let zdt = date(2024, 7, 10).at(20, 48, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2024-07-10T20:48:00-04:00[America/New_York]");

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

And this example parses a zone aware datetime from a string:

```
use jiff::Zoned;

let zdt: Zoned = "2024-07-10 20:48[america/new_york]".parse()?;
assert_eq!(zdt.year(), 2024);
assert_eq!(zdt.month(), 7);
assert_eq!(zdt.day(), 10);
assert_eq!(zdt.hour(), 20);
assert_eq!(zdt.minute(), 48);
assert_eq!(zdt.offset().seconds(), -4 * 60 * 60);
assert_eq!(zdt.time_zone().iana_name(), Some("America/New_York"));

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Yet, neither of the above examples require uttering [`TimeZone`]. This is
because the datetime types in this crate provide higher level abstractions for
working with time zone identifiers. Nevertheless, sometimes it is useful to
work with a `TimeZone` directly. For example, if one has a `TimeZone`, then
conversion from a [`Timestamp`](crate::Timestamp) to a [`Zoned`](crate::Zoned)
is infallible:

```
use jiff::{tz::TimeZone, Timestamp, Zoned};

let tz = TimeZone::get("America/New_York")?;
let ts = Timestamp::UNIX_EPOCH;
let zdt = ts.to_zoned(tz);
assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "1969-12-31T19:00:00-05:00[America/New_York]");

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

# The [IANA Time Zone Database]

Since a time zone is a set of rules for determining the civil time, via an
offset from UTC, in a particular geographic region, a database is required to
represent the full complexity of these rules in practice. The standard database
is widespread use is the [IANA Time Zone Database]. On Unix systems, this is
typically found at `/usr/share/zoneinfo`, and Jiff will read it automatically.
On Windows systems, there is no canonical Time Zone Database installation, and
so Jiff embeds it into the compiled artifact. (This does not happen on Unix
by default.)

See the [`TimeZoneDatabase`] for more information.

# The system or "local" time zone

In many cases, the operating system manages a "default" time zone. It might,
for example, be how the `date` program converts a Unix timestamp to a time that
is "local" to you.

Unfortunately, there is no universal approach to discovering a system's default
time zone. Instead, Jiff uses heuristics like reading `/etc/localtime` on Unix,
and calling [`GetDynamicTimeZoneInformation`] on Windows. But in all cases,
Jiff will always use the IANA Time Zone Database for implementing time zone
transition rules. (For example, Windows specific APIs for time zone transitions
are not supported by Jiff.)

Moreover, Jiff supports reading the `TZ` environment variable, as specified
by POSIX, on all systems.

To get the system's default time zone, use [`TimeZone::system`].

# Core-only environments

By default, Jiff attempts to read time zone rules from `/usr/share/zoneinfo`
on Unix and a bundled database on other platforms (like on Windows). This happens
at runtime, and aside from requiring APIs to interact with the file system
on Unix, it also requires dynamic memory allocation.

For core-only environments that don't have file system APIs or dynamic
memory allocation, Jiff provides a way to construct `TimeZone` values at
compile time by compiling time zone rules into your binary. This does mean
that your program will need to be re-compiled if the time zone rules change
(in contrast to Jiff's default behavior of reading `/usr/share/zoneinfo` at
runtime on Unix), but sometimes there isn't a practical alternative.

With the `static` crate feature enabled, the [`jiff::tz::get`](crate::tz::get)
macro becomes available in this module. This example shows how use it to build
a `TimeZone` at compile time. Here, we find the next DST transition from a
particular timestamp in `Europe/Zurich`, and then print that in local time for
Zurich:

```
use jiff::{tz::{self, TimeZone}, Timestamp};

static TZ: TimeZone = tz::get!("Europe/Zurich");

let ts: Timestamp = "2025-02-25T00:00Z".parse()?;
let Some(next_transition) = TZ.following(ts).next() else {
    return Err("no time zone transitions".into());
};
let zdt = next_transition.timestamp().to_zoned(TZ.clone());
assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2025-03-30T03:00:00+02:00[Europe/Zurich]");

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

The above example does not require dynamic memory allocation or access to file
system APIs. It also _only_ embeds the `Europe/Zurich` time zone into your
compiled binary.
