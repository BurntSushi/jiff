/// A handle to a [IANA Time Zone Database].
///
/// A `TimeZoneDatabase` provides a way to lookup [`TimeZone`]s by their
/// human readable identifiers, such as `America/Los_Angeles` and
/// `Europe/Warsaw`.
///
/// It is rare to need to create or use this type directly. Routines
/// like zoned datetime parsing and time zone conversion provide
/// convenience routines for using an implicit global time zone database
/// by default. This global time zone database is available via
/// [`jiff::tz::db`](crate::tz::db()`). But lower level parsing routines
/// such as
/// [`fmt::temporal::DateTimeParser::parse_zoned_with`](crate::fmt::temporal::DateTimeParser::parse_zoned_with)
/// and
/// [`civil::DateTime::to_zoned`](crate::civil::DateTime::to_zoned) provide a
/// means to use a custom copy of a `TimeZoneDatabase`.
///
/// # Platform behavior
///
/// This behavior is subject to change.
///
/// On Unix systems, and when the `tzdb-zoneinfo` crate feature is enabled
/// (which it is by default), Jiff will read the `/usr/share/zoneinfo`
/// directory for time zone data.
///
/// On Windows systems and when the `tzdb-bundle-platform` crate feature is
/// enabled (which it is by default), _or_ when the `tzdb-bundle-always` crate
/// feature is enabled, then the `jiff-tzdb` crate will be used to embed the
/// entire Time Zone Database into the compiled artifact.
///
/// On Android systems, and when the `tzdb-concatenated` crate feature is
/// enabled (which it is by default), Jiff will attempt to read a concatenated
/// zoneinfo database using the `ANDROID_DATA` or `ANDROID_ROOT` environment
/// variables.
///
/// In general, using `/usr/share/zoneinfo` (or an equivalent) is heavily
/// preferred in lieu of embedding the database into your compiled artifact.
/// The reason is because your system copy of the Time Zone Database may be
/// updated, perhaps a few times a year, and it is better to get seamless
/// updates through your system rather than needing to wait on a Rust crate
/// to update and then rebuild your software. The bundling approach should
/// only be used when there is no plausible alternative. For example, Windows
/// has no canonical location for a copy of the Time Zone Database. Indeed,
/// this is why the Cargo configuration of Jiff specifically does not enabled
/// bundling by default on Unix systems, but does enable it by default on
/// Windows systems. Of course, if you really do need a copy of the database
/// bundled, then you can enable the `tzdb-bundle-always` crate feature.
///
/// # Cloning
///
/// A `TimeZoneDatabase` can be cheaply cloned. It will share a thread safe
/// cache with other copies of the same `TimeZoneDatabase`.
///
/// # Caching
///
/// Because looking up a time zone on disk, reading the file into memory
/// and parsing the time zone transitions out of that file requires
/// a fair amount of work, a `TimeZoneDatabase` does a fair bit of
/// caching. This means that the vast majority of calls to, for example,
/// [`Timestamp::in_tz`](crate::Timestamp::in_tz) don't actually need to hit
/// disk. It will just find a cached copy of a [`TimeZone`] and return that.
///
/// Of course, with caching comes problems of cache invalidation. Invariably,
/// there are parameters that Jiff uses to manage when the cache should be
/// invalidated. Jiff tries to emit log messages about this when it happens. If
/// you find the caching behavior of Jiff to be sub-optimal for your use case,
/// please create an issue. (The plan is likely to expose some options for
/// configuring the behavior of a `TimeZoneDatabase`, but I wanted to collect
/// user feedback first.)
///
/// [IANA Time Zone Database]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database
///
/// # Example: list all available time zones
///
/// ```no_run
/// use jiff::tz;
///
/// for tzid in tz::db().available() {
///     println!("{tzid}");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Example: using multiple time zone databases
///
/// Jiff supports opening and using multiple time zone databases by default.
/// All you need to do is point [`TimeZoneDatabase::from_dir`] to your own
/// copy of the Time Zone Database, and it will handle the rest.
///
/// This example shows how to utilize multiple databases by parsing a datetime
/// using an older copy of the IANA Time Zone Database. This example leverages
/// the fact that the 2018 copy of the database preceded Brazil's announcement
/// that daylight saving time would be abolished. This meant that datetimes
/// in the future, when parsed with the older copy of the Time Zone Database,
/// would still follow the old daylight saving time rules. But a mere update of
/// the database would otherwise change the meaning of the datetime.
///
/// This scenario can come up if one stores datetimes in the future. This is
/// also why the default offset conflict resolution strategy when parsing zoned
/// datetimes is [`OffsetConflict::Reject`](crate::tz::OffsetConflict::Reject),
/// which prevents one from silently re-interpreting datetimes to a different
/// timestamp.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use jiff::{fmt::temporal::DateTimeParser, tz::{self, TimeZoneDatabase}};
///
/// static PARSER: DateTimeParser = DateTimeParser::new();
///
/// // Open a version of tzdb from before Brazil announced its abolition
/// // of daylight saving time.
/// let tzdb2018 = TimeZoneDatabase::from_dir("path/to/tzdb-2018b")?;
/// // Open the system tzdb.
/// let tzdb = tz::db();
///
/// // Parse the same datetime string with the same parser, but using two
/// // different versions of tzdb.
/// let dt = "2020-01-15T12:00[America/Sao_Paulo]";
/// let zdt2018 = PARSER.parse_zoned_with(&tzdb2018, dt)?;
/// let zdt = PARSER.parse_zoned_with(tzdb, dt)?;
///
/// // Before DST was abolished, 2020-01-15 was in DST, which corresponded
/// // to UTC offset -02. Since DST rules applied to datetimes in the
/// // future, the 2018 version of tzdb would lead one to interpret
/// // 2020-01-15 as being in DST.
/// assert_eq!(zdt2018.offset(), tz::offset(-2));
/// // But DST was abolished in 2019, which means that 2020-01-15 was no
/// // no longer in DST. So after a tzdb update, the same datetime as above
/// // now has a different offset.
/// assert_eq!(zdt.offset(), tz::offset(-3));
///
/// // So if you try to parse a datetime serialized from an older copy of
/// // tzdb, you'll get an error under the default configuration because
/// // of `OffsetConflict::Reject`. This would succeed if you parsed it
/// // using tzdb2018!

    /// # Data generation

    /// The data in this crate comes from the [IANA Time Zone Database] "data

    /// into binary TZif data using the `zic` compiler, and secondly, converts
    /// the binary data into a flattened and de-duplicated representation that
    /// is embedded into this crate's source code.
    ///
    /// The conversion into the TZif binary data uses the following settings:
    ///
    /// * The "rearguard" data is used (see below).
    /// * The binary data itself is compiled using the "slim" format. Which
    ///   effectively means that the TZif data primarily only uses explicit
    ///   time zone transitions for historical data and POSIX time zones for
    ///   current time zone transition rules. This doesn't have any impact
    ///   on the actual results. The reason that there are "slim" and "fat"
    ///   formats is to support legacy applications that can't deal with
    ///   POSIX time zones. For example, `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on my modern
    ///   Archlinux installation (2025-02-27) is in the "fat" format.
    ///
    /// The reason that rearguard data is used is a bit more subtle and has
    /// to do with a difference in how the IANA Time Zone Database treats its
    /// internal "daylight saving time" flag and what people in the "real
    /// world" consider "daylight saving time." For example, in the standard
    /// distribution of the IANA Time Zone Database, `Europe/Dublin` has its
    /// daylight saving time flag set to _true_ during Winter and set to
    /// _false_ during Summer. The actual time shifts are the same as, e.g.,
    /// `Europe/London`, but which one is actually labeled "daylight saving
    /// time" is not.
    ///
    /// The IANA Time Zone Database does this for `Europe/Dublin`, presumably,
    /// because _legally_, time during the Summer in Ireland is called `Irish
    /// Standard Time`, and time during the Winter is called `Greenwich Mean
    /// Time`. These legal names are reversed from what is typically the case,
    /// where "standard" time is during the Winter and daylight saving time is
    /// during the Summer. The IANA Time Zone Database implements this tweak in
    /// legal language via a "negative daylight saving time offset." This is
    /// somewhat odd, and some consumers of the IANA Time Zone Database cannot
    /// handle it. Thus, the rearguard format was born for, seemingly, legacy
    /// programs.
    ///
    /// Jiff can handle negative daylight saving time offsets just fine,
    /// but we use the rearguard format anyway so that the underlying data
    /// more accurately reflects on-the-ground reality for humans living in
    /// `Europe/Dublin`. In particular, using the rearguard data enables
    /// [localization of time zone names] to be done correctly.
